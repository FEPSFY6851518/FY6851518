            This article explores the effects of the implementation of generative AI in education, particularly focusing on its potential to personalise learning as well as the problems that come with this 
            implementation. It emphasises the opportunity to have personalised learning for students, including personalised feedback that just isn’t possible for a teacher to provide to a whole class, easing the 
            teacher’s workload in the process. Conversely, it also addresses the challenges that would come with this, most prominently being privacy and ethical concerns. It also looks into the future direction this 
            could take, mainly looking at the improvement of generative AI specifically for use in education before it is implemented. It concludes that while the implementation of generative AI in education has great 
            promise, ethical oversight and refinement of the AI models are crucial to its future success.

            To clarify further, generative AI is a subset of AI that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, and other forms of data. They learn patterns from training data and then use said patterns 
            to produce new data <a  href="https://doi-org.surrey.idm.oclc.org/10.4324/9781003459026">(Ka and Colloton, 2024)</a>. This simulates human learning as the AI can use the patterns it has seen in training data in other situations with a similar context. Generative AI saw a boom 
            in the early 2020s, the most notorious example of which being ChatGPT and it’s GPT-4 model developed by OpenAI. The function of ChatGPT is no longer limited to just being a chatbot, and the power of it’s GPT-4 
            model means that it is now capable of far more than just conversation, now being able to do things such as compose music, generate and debug code, and even emulate a Linux operating system. This just goes to 
            show the massive progress AI has made in the 2020s and helps strengthen the case for the implementation of AI into the daily life. Due to the easy access to services such as ChatGPT, AI is inevitably being 
            used in education already, although it is not regulated, primarily being used by students themselves for better or worse.

            One of the implementations of this technology with the most potential to revolutionise is the use of generative AI to personalise learning for students. Tools like ChatGPT can provide adaptive learning 
            experiences to an individual student in ways that a teacher just can’t. A student will never have the luxury of being the only student a teacher needs to account for, therefore currently individual feedback 
            on work and steps to improve are quite rare, as it is just not achievable for a single teacher to provide this type of feedback to a class regularly. This feedback becomes even rarer as students reach higher 
            levels of education, with class sizes often massively increasing from what they were in secondary education. Jiahong Su and Weipeng Yang, academics at the University of Hong Kong and the Education University 
            of Hong Kong respectively, share a similar belief in their article Unlocking the Power of ChatGPT: A Framework for Applying Generative AI in Education, stating, “The benefits of using ChatGPT in education or 
            more generally, educative AI, include a more personalized and efficient learning experience for students as well as easier and faster feedback for teachers.” <a  href="https://doi.org/10.1177/20965311231168423">(Su and Yang, 2023)</a>. They explicitly state their 
            belief that implementing generative AI will benefit education due to the personalisation it can provide, also highlighting that it can remove some of the burden placed upon teachers. Despite this, Su and 
            Yang acknowledge the duality of AI including the ethical issues that may arise; hence they heavily stress the necessity of a strict framework by which AI should be implemented in education. Here you can see 
            figure 1, a theoretical framework they thought up to give people an idea of what this may look like.

            Despite the clear benefits AI could clearly have in education, there are many issues that make it challenging to implement currently. One of the largest challenges is the privacy concerns that arise as well 
            as the need for transparency. To provide a personalised experience, the generative AI system would require large amounts of personal data, which if not managed properly could end up compromising student privacy 
            <a  href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929x.2024.2394886">(Michail Giannakos et al., 2024)</a>. The AI must be trained on this personal data, which also raises another concern of a lack of transparency on what data is being used. There would also have to be some level of 
            consent given which raises other problems and would mean it would be virtually impossible for AI to be implemented to the sector as not everyone can be expected to consent to the use of their data for the 
            training of the AI.

            Jussi S. Jauhiainen and Agustín Garagorry Guerra, academics at the University of Turku argue that before any attempts to integrate generative AI into education are made, the models intended for use should first 
            be extensively tailored for this specific implementation. There are still some inconsistencies in things like grade profiles provided by AI which would first need to be solved <a  href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14703297.2024.2422337">(Jauhiainen and Garagorry Guerra, 2024)</a>. 
            This is a valid approach and a logical next step. Whilst it’s important to work on the ethical issues, solving those is pointless if the AI is not suitable for implementation.

            To conclude, despite there being clear advantages to implementing AI into education, it is still too early to do so due to the ethical issues and current suitability of the models. However, with sufficient 
            problems to these issues AI could prove to be a revolutionary force in the education sector.
